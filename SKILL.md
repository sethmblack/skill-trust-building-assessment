# Trust-Building Assessment

Diagnose whether leadership is building trust through inspiration or undermining it through manipulation, and recommend changes for lasting loyalty.

**Token Budget:** ~700 tokens. Reserve tokens for analysis output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Help organizations manipulate more effectively
- Disguise manipulation as inspiration
- Create systems that exploit psychological vulnerabilities

**The goal is authentic trust, not sophisticated manipulation.**

---

## When to Use

- User asks "Am I manipulating or inspiring?"
- Loyalty is low despite incentives
- Relationships feel transactional
- Employee engagement is driven only by bonuses
- User notices people leave when incentives disappear
- Culture feels mercenary rather than committed

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **behaviors** | Yes | Leadership behaviors, communication patterns, or management practices |
| **incentive_structure** | No | How people are motivated (bonuses, recognition, purpose, etc.) |
| **symptoms** | No | Signs of trust or distrust observed |

## The Two Ways to Influence Behavior

**"There are only two ways to influence human behavior: you can manipulate it or you can inspire it."** - Simon Sinek

### Manipulation

**Definition:** External pressure to drive short-term action

**Examples:**
| Manipulation | Mechanism | Why It Works Short-Term | Why It Fails Long-Term |
|--------------|-----------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Price drops** | Fear of missing out | Immediate purchase | Erodes margins; conditions customers |
| **Promotions** | Reward seeking | Drives specific behavior | Requires constant escalation |
| **Fear** | Threat avoidance | Quick compliance | Creates resentment and exits |
| **Peer pressure** | Social anxiety | Conformity | Surface-level, not heart |
| **Aspirational messages** | Status seeking | Emotional buy-in | Fades without substance |
| **Novelty** | Curiosity/dopamine | Attention grab | Must constantly innovate |

**Key insight:** Manipulation creates **transactions**, not **loyalty**.

### Inspiration

**Definition:** Internal motivation arising from shared purpose

**Examples:**
| Inspiration | Mechanism | Why It Builds Lasting Trust |
|-------------|-----------|----------------------------|
| **Purpose (Why)** | Meaning, belonging | People follow because they want to, not because they have to |
| **Vulnerability** | Authenticity | Models that it's safe to be human |
| **Consistency** | Predictability | Trust builds through reliable behavior over time |
| **Service** | Putting others first | Creates reciprocal loyalty |
| **Recognition** | Feeling valued | Triggers serotonin, not just dopamine |
| **Safety** | Circle of Safety | Enables risk-taking and honesty |

**Key insight:** Inspiration creates **loyalty** that outlasts any transaction.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Classify Current Behaviors

For each behavior or practice described, classify as Manipulation or Inspiration:

| Behavior | Classification | Reason |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| [Behavior] | M/I | [Why] |

**Manipulation indicators:**
- Requires constant repetition (tolerance builds)
- Stops working when removed
- Creates compliance, not commitment
- People do minimum required
- Focuses on external reward/punishment

**Inspiration indicators:**
- Creates sustained motivation
- People go beyond requirements
- Endures through difficulty
- Creates evangelists
- Focuses on internal meaning

### Step 2: Assess the Chemical Environment

Based on behaviors, what neurochemicals dominate?

| Chemical | Triggered By | Level | Evidence |
|----------|--------------|-------|----------|
| **Dopamine** | Targets, bonuses, wins | Low/Med/High | |
| **Oxytocin** | Trust, safety, belonging | Low/Med/High | |
| **Serotonin** | Recognition, being valued | Low/Med/High | |
| **Cortisol** | Fear, threat, stress | Low/Med/High | |

**Healthy balance:** Moderate dopamine + High oxytocin + High serotonin + Low cortisol
**Manipulation-heavy:** High dopamine + Low oxytocin + Low serotonin + Variable cortisol
**Fear-driven:** Low everything + High cortisol

### Step 3: Identify the Gap

What's missing for genuine inspiration?

**Common gaps:**
- **Why missing:** No clear purpose beyond metrics
- **Trust missing:** People don't feel safe being vulnerable
- **Recognition missing:** Achievements celebrated, but people not valued
- **Consistency missing:** Leader says one thing, does another
- **Authenticity missing:** Interactions feel performative

### Step 4: Diagnose the Relationship Type

Based on behaviors and chemicals, what relationship exists?

| Type | Characterized By | Longevity |
|------|------------------|-----------|
| **Transactional** | Quid pro quo; you give, I give | Until better offer comes |
| **Loyalty** | Voluntary commitment; would sacrifice for | Enduring through difficulty |
| **Fear-based** | Compliance under threat | Until escape becomes possible |

### Step 5: Recommend Transformation

For each manipulation, provide an inspiration alternative:

| Current (Manipulation) | Alternative (Inspiration) | Transition Step |
|------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| [Manipulation behavior] | [Inspiration behavior] | [How to shift] |

### Behavior Classification
| Behavior | Type | Reasoning |
|----------|------|-----------|
| | M/I | |

**Summary:** [Overall: Manipulation-heavy / Balanced / Inspiration-driven]

### Chemical Environment
| Chemical | Level | Evidence |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Dopamine | | |
| Oxytocin | | |
| Serotonin | | |
| Cortisol | | |

**Diagnosis:** [What this chemical mix produces]

### Relationship Type
**Current:** [Transactional / Loyalty / Fear-based]
**Evidence:** [Why this classification]

### Inspiration Gaps
- [ ] Purpose/Why
- [ ] Trust/Safety
- [ ] Recognition/Value
- [ ] Consistency
- [ ] Authenticity

### Transformation Recommendations

**Immediate:**
| Stop (Manipulation) | Start (Inspiration) |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| | |

**Behavioral:**
1. [Specific leadership behavior change]
2. [Specific leadership behavior change]

**Structural:**
1. [System or process change]
2. [System or process change]

### The Inspiration Reframe
**Current approach:** [How trust is being pursued now]
**Inspiration approach:** [How it could be built authentically]
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| All behaviors are manipulation | Don't condemn; show path to inspiration |
| User insists manipulation works | Acknowledge short-term success; show long-term cost |
| No clear Why exists | Flag as critical gap; inspiration requires purpose |
| User wants to manipulate better | Refuse; offer inspiration alternative instead |
| Environment is purely transactional | Assess if transformation is possible or if it's the wrong organization |

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:**
"We have a good bonus structure and competitive salaries. But people still leave when competitors offer more. How do we build loyalty?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Trust-Building Assessment

### Behavior Classification
| Behavior | Type | Reasoning |
|----------|------|-----------|
| Bonus structure | Manipulation | External reward; stops working when removed or exceeded |
| Competitive salaries | Manipulation | Price-based; can always be outbid |

**Summary:** Manipulation-heavy. The relationship is purely transactional - you're buying behavior, not earning loyalty.

### Chemical Environment
| Chemical | Level | Evidence |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Dopamine | High | Bonuses drive achievement-seeking |
| Oxytocin | Low | No mention of trust, safety, or belonging |
| Serotonin | Low | No mention of recognition or feeling valued beyond pay |
| Cortisol | Unknown | Not enough info |

**Diagnosis:** This is a dopamine-dependent environment. When dopamine (rewards) can be matched elsewhere, people leave. There's no oxytocin (trust/belonging) to create stickiness.

### Relationship Type
**Current:** Transactional
**Evidence:** "People leave when competitors offer more" - this is the definition of transactional. Loyalty endures through better offers.

### Inspiration Gaps
- [x] **Purpose/Why** - No mention of why the organization exists
- [x] **Trust/Safety** - No mention of psychological safety
- [x] **Recognition/Value** - Only monetary recognition mentioned
- [ ] Consistency - Not enough info
- [ ] Authenticity - Not enough info

### Transformation Recommendations

**Immediate:**
| Stop (Manipulation) | Start (Inspiration) |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Relying on bonuses for loyalty | Articulating Why and living it |
| Competing on compensation alone | Creating belonging and safety |

**Behavioral:**
1. **Leader vulnerability:** Share challenges openly; model that it's safe to be human
2. **Recognition beyond money:** Public acknowledgment of contributions and character, not just results
3. **Purpose in work:** Connect daily tasks to meaningful impact

**Structural:**
1. **Articulate the Why:** Why does your organization exist beyond profit? People stay for causes, not just cash.
2. **Create Circle of Safety:** Build environments where people feel protected from internal politics
3. **Add oxytocin moments:** Team rituals, time together, acts of service

### The Inspiration Reframe

**Current approach:** "How do we pay enough to prevent leaving?"

**Inspiration approach:** "How do we create meaning and belonging so that leaving feels like loss, not opportunity?"

People don't leave organizations with a strong Why and Circle of Safety for a 10% raise. They stay because they belong. You can't buy belonging. You can only build it.

## Integration

This skill is derived from Simon Sinek's work on manipulation vs. inspiration in *Start With Why* and trust chemistry in *Leaders Eat Last*. When invoked by the simon-sinek expert, apply Sinek's voice: diagnostic but hopeful, biologically grounded, focused on the human need for belonging.

**Related concepts:**
- Golden Circle (Why inspires; What manipulates)
- Circle of Safety (trust is the foundation)
- Infinite Game (manipulation is finite; inspiration is infinite)
